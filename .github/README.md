# DCMTK+tweaks

This repository contains modifications and extensions to DCMTK utilities that I find useful (primarily for use in shell scripts).

Modified executibles are suffixed with a "+" to avoid conflicts with official executables.

* **storescp+** storescp with Maildir-inspired delivery behavior
* **dcmftest+** dcmftest with adaptations to simplify use in shell scripts
