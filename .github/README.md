# DCMTK+tweaks

This repository contains modifications and extensions to DCMTK utilities that I find useful (primarily for use in shell scripts).

Modified executibles are siffixed with a "+" to avoid conflicts with official executables.

* **storescp+** extended storescp that provides Maildir-inspired delivery
* **dcmftest+** extended dcmftest to simplify use in shell scripts
